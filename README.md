# Matplotlib Homework - The Power of Plots

## Background

What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?

So, let's take what you've learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a real-world situation and dataset:

While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government, you remained adamant that science was the way for you. Staying true to your mission, you've joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. The executive team also has asked for a top-level summary of the study results.

## Analysis

Overall, it is clear that Capomulin is a viable drug regimen to reduce tumor growth.

Capomulin had the most number of mice complete the study, with the exception of Remicane, all other regimens observed a number of mice deaths across the duration of the study. 

There is a strong correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume, indicating that mouse weight may be contributing to the effectiveness of any drug regimen.

There was one potential outlier within the Infubinol regimen. While most mice showed tumor volume increase, there was one mouse that had a reduction in tumor growth in the study.
